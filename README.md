# spacex_modeling
----------------------------
This project is aimed to model space x data and make prediction for any successful landing of falcon 9.

The first step to to web scrap and get data from spaceX api keys.
This are our objectives for the first mining:
(getting)
- Booster version from the rocket database
- Launch site and get, latitude, longitude, and the name
- Payload getting the mass kilograms and the orbit
- core(the outcome for landing). We will get the following data, type of landing, number of flights with the core, whether grids were used, whether the core we re-used, whether legs were used, landing pad used, block of the core( number used to separate version cores), number of times the specific core has been reused and finally serial of the core.
